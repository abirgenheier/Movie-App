## Usage
* A complete front end, UI/UX application powered which allows users to select and search for all movies released to date, select condiments, and even check out. 
* Usage of dynamic interface to allow user to simultaneously select from beverage and food options, checkout, select seats in movie theater, as well as to select a specific movie and check reviews for that specified movie.
* Complete front end application with no back end set up. Allows for future segway to attach backend and allow for local movie theaters to power off with usage of privatized database.

## Learning Experiences 
* Different styling approaches for more interactive and appealing UI/UX.
* Technical application of APIs through DOM manipulation and iterations for visual effects.
* Usage of local storage to save selected seats from user input.
* Simultaneous DOM manipulation through dynamic event listeners
